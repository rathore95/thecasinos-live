Task: Make this website compliant for Google Gambling Ads certification as an affiliate comparison website (not a casino operator). Do NOT use cloaking. The same HTML must be shown to users and Googlebots. Apply all of the following changes:

A) Add Age Verification
1. Create a blocking age verification modal.
2. The modal must appear before the main page is usable.
3. Buttons:
   - “I am 18+” → set cookie age_confirmed=1 (12h expiry) and close modal.
   - “No / Leave” → redirect to https://www.google.com.
4. If age_confirmed cookie is missing → modal stays open and page is blocked.

B) Create Footer Legal Pages (these must be **real** pages with content, linked site-wide):
   /privacy
   /terms
   /responsible-gambling
   /about
   /contact

Footer must show:
© 2025 TheCasinos.live | 18+ Only | Play Responsibly
Links: About | Terms | Privacy | Responsible Gambling | Contact

C) Affiliate Disclosure (must be visible)
Add site-wide near header + footer:
“We may receive commissions when you sign up via our links. Our rankings and opinions are independent.”

D) Offerwall and Redirect Flow
1. Every brand card button should link to:
   /out?brand=BRAND_SLUG
   (No direct affiliate links on the offerwall.)

2. Create a new /out page:
   - Read ?brand parameter.
   - Look up brand data from a brand config (JSON/JS object).
   - Display:
       • Brand name & logo
       • License Authority + License Number + Verification URL
       • Bonus summary terms (e.g., New customers only, 18+, wagering applies)
       • Button: “Proceed to Official Site”
   - When button clicked:
       Log click (brand + timestamp) then redirect to brand.affiliateUrl.
   - No automatic redirect. User must click manually.

E) Brand Card Requirements (on homepage/offerwall)
Each card must display:
- Licensed by <Regulator> (License #)
- “New players only. 18+. Bonus subject to wagering. T&Cs apply.”

F) Brand Config File Example (store as brands.json or JS export):
[
  {
    "slug": "richprize",
    "name": "RichPrize Casino",
    "logo": "/assets/richprize.png",
    "affiliateUrl": "YOUR_AFFILIATE_LINK",
    "license": {
      "regulator": "Curacao eGaming",
      "number": "8048/JAZ",
      "verificationUrl": "https://www.curacao-egaming.com/validate/..."
    },
    "bonusSummary": "18+ only. New customers. Min deposit. Wagering applies. T&Cs apply."
  }
]

G) Technical Requirements
- No auto-redirects anywhere.
- No blocked content for Googlebot.
- No pop-ups that trap user.
- All pages return HTTP 200.
- Works on mobile and desktop with no JS errors.

H) Acceptance Test (must pass before we stop)
1. Fresh browser → homepage opens with age-gate blocking view.
2. After confirming age → offerwall is visible.
3. Clicking a brand → goes to /out?brand=…
4. /out displays license + bonus details and a Proceed button.
5. Only after clicking Proceed → user is sent to affiliate link.
6. Footer pages open and contain real text content.
7. Affiliate disclosure visible.
